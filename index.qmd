# Example Text about Otters

![](img/otter.png)

From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otter>

Otters are carnivorous mammals in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are all semiaquatic, aquatic, or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a branch of the Mustelidae family, which also includes weasels, badgers, mink, and wolverines, among other animals.

## Etymology

The word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter. This and cognate words in other Indo-European languages ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European root *wÃ³drÌ¥, which also gave rise to the English word "water".

## Terminology

An otter's den is called a holt, or couch
The collective nouns for otters are bevy, family, lodge, romp (being descriptive of their often playful nature), or, when in water, raft
Male otters are called dogs or boars; females are called bitches or sows; and their offspring are called pups or cubs.

# Code Examples

@R-palmerpenguins

## R

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r}
#' @title hello
#' @description A simple function to greet someone
#' @param name A character string with the name of the person to greet
greet <- function(name) {
  text <- paste0("Hello ", name)
  return(text)
}
```

```{r}
greet("world")
```


```{r}
ggplot(penguins,
  aes(
    x = bill_length_mm,
    y = flipper_length_mm
  )
) + geom_point()
```

## Python

```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from plotnine import * # pyright: ignore
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins

plt.ion()

penguins: DataFrame = load_penguins() # type: ignore
penguins.columns
```


```{python}
p = (
  ggplot(penguins, aes('bill_length_mm', 'flipper_length_mm',))
  + geom_point()
)
p.show()
```
